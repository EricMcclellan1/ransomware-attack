## Summary

In this project I built a fake environment for a student, using Oracle VirtualBox and then attacking the system using a ransomware attack, utilizing visual studio for the creation of the virus code.  

I learned how ransomware works on the coding side of things, as well as how quick a system can get encrypted if you do get hacked.


## Technologies & Components Used

- Windows Server 2019
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Visual Studio Community 2019 
	-.NET desktop Development
- File and Storage Services
- VirusTotal
- C#
- Windows Security
- Firewall



## Set-Up
I worked with virtualBox to create the fake student environment, (making sure to not use my personal pc/mac since we are dealing with viruses) using a windows 2019 ISO.
